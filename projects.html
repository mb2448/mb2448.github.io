<h4> Minerva </h4>
<p>
Radial velocity detection of low-mass exoplanets is a challenging
task, both due to the high precision required and large amount of
observing time necessary for dense orbital phase coverage.&nbsp;
Minerva (MINiature Exoplanet Radial Velocity Array) tackles these two
issues simultaneously, using four automated 0.7 m telescopes
fiber-feeding the same high-resolution spectrograph.&nbsp; It is
designed for
high-cadence, high-precision radial velocity searches for extrasolar
planets orbiting nearby stars, with additional photometric
capabilities.&nbsp; Its final location is Mt. Hopkins observatory in
Arizona,
but the telescope, enclosure, and related hardware are currently being
tested and configured here in Pasadena.

<p>I work primarily on the implementation of the telescope system--ie,
the
hardware and software.&nbsp; I also performed an end-to-end simulation
of the optimal design of a Minerva-like survey, the results of which
were published here.&nbsp;

<h4> High-contrast imaging with the a multistage vortex coronagraph </h4>
<p>
High contrast imaging is the most promising way of studying planets at
intermediate to large separations from their host stars.&nbsp;
Discovery of these planets is necessary in order to understand
exoplanet population statistics, exoplanet chemistry, the formation and
migration mechanisms of planetary systems, and their relationship to
dust structures.&nbsp; However, direct imaging of planets is currently
limited both by achievable contrast and by the inner working angle,
which limit how faint and close-in companions can be detected.&nbsp; To
make progress in these areas, we are developing a new coronagraph at
JPL, the &#8220;Stellar Double Coronagraph&#8221; (SDC).&nbsp; Unlike conventional
coronagraphs, this uses a device called an optical vortex,&nbsp;
capable of reaching high contrast (10<sup>-6</sup> &#8211; 10<sup>-7</sup>)
at very small angles
(~70 mas at H-band), or 0.9 <small>&#955;</small>/D , from the
ground.&nbsp;
This will
allow imaging of young, sub-Jupiter mass planets at ~AU separations
around nearby stars, which are predicted to be much more common than
currently imaged planets.

<h4> Precision near-infrared radial velocities </h4>

<p>The near-infrared (NIR) bands are a promising but difficult place to
do
high-precision Doppler spectroscopy.&nbsp; Small stars, which emit most
of their flux in the NIR, have much higher reflex velocities from
habitable-zone planets, making them excellent targets for
radial-velocity surveys.&nbsp; However, until recently, the
instrumental stability and referencing that have resulted in successful
visible-light instruments have simply not existed in the infrared.</p>

A prototype high-precision radial velocity system has been under
development at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF).&nbsp; An
isotopic methane cell is used as a wavelength reference, and a fiber
optic scrambling system is used to produce a highly stable output
illumination pattern.
<p>I worked on the design, construction, and testing&nbsp; of the fiber
optic scrambler, and participated in the commissioning run at
IRTF.&nbsp; I am currently involved in the&nbsp; observing program,
where we are pushing the limits of the instrument's performance, down
to the few m/s level.</p>

<h4> Spectral characterization of M dwarfs</h4>
<p>
M dwarfs are the most common stars in the universe, and also the longest-lived: typically, they have main-sequence lifetimes dozens to hundreds of times the current age of the universe.  The fact that they have not yet had time to evolve off of the main sequence provides a unique opportunity for characterization, as metallicity is no longer degenerate with age.
</p>
<p>
Sebastian Pineda, John Johnson and I developed a method of deducing the physical properties (mass, metallicity, absolute magnitude, etc) of M dwarfs using high-resolution spectroscopy.  We combined over 15 years' worth of Keck spectra to create high signal-to-noise spectra of ~150 M dwarfs. We determined areas of the spectra sensitive to the fundamental properties of these stars, and then used  spectral indices to determine these properties for uncharacterized M dwarfs.

<h4> LAEDI </h4>
<p>LAEDI (Lock-in Amplified Externally Dispersed Interferometer) is a novel testbed instrument built to achieve an unprecedented 10 cm/s of velocity precision on celestial objects, small enough to detect the p-mode oscillations on the Sun, or even the tug of the Earth. It will point the way towards extreme-precision instruments on the next generation of telescopes, capable of detecting habitable planets around Sun-like stars.
</p>
<p>I assisted with the construction and testing of the hardware, particularly towards the goal of interfacing LAEDI as an instrument on the Palomar 200-inch telescope, fed by its highly advanced P3K adaptive-optics system.

<h4>Fourier transform spectroscopy of microwave filters</h4>
<p>Before coming to graduate school, I worked in Amber Miller's CMB lab, manufacturing and testing microwave filters for use in CMB experiments.  A large fraction of this time was spent building a Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) to test these filters.  While I don't currently do research in CMB physics, this experience taught me a great deal about optics, electronics, and being a good researcher, and motivated me to pursue a career in experimental astrophysics.</p>
