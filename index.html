<p>I am an experimental astrophysicist working on exoplanet detection.  I pursue this goal by building and using ground and space-based instruments and developing new data analysis techniques. 

<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
I received BAs in physics and mathematics from Columbia University in
2008, and worked at a hedge fund as a professional stock trader for the
following year before returning to scientific research in <a href="http://cosmology.phys.columbia.edu/group_web/index.php">Amber
Miller's CMB group</a>. In 2010 I began graduate studies in
astrophysics at the  California Institute of Technology, jointly advised by <a href="http://www.astro.caltech.edu/%7Esrk/">Shri Kulkarni</a>
and <a href="http://astronomy.fas.harvard.edu/people/john-asher-johnson">John
Johnson</a>. During graduate school, I was supported by a NASA Space Technology Research Fellowship.<br>  I received my PhD in 2016 and joined the staff of the Jet Propulsion Lab immediately afterwards.<br>
<br>
Aside from astrophysics, I am interested in optics,
electronics, and programming.&nbsp; <br>
